\abstract{
Manipulation planning is a field of study with increasing interest, it merges manipulation skills with an artificial intelligence system that is able to find the optimal sequence of actions in order to solve manipulation problems. Those problems are complex since they involve a mixture of symbolic planning and geometric planning. 

In this thesis we present a planning system for clearing a table of cluttered objects, which completely reasons at a symbolic level postponing the reasoning with geometric constraints through backtracking. The task we face is a complex task that should include geometric information, such as the objects positions, during the planning step. 
We show that the planning system developed is able to handle efficiently the task with symbolic predicates.

The main contribution of this thesis is a planning system able to solve a wider variety of scenarios for clearing a table of cluttered objects. Grasping actions alone are not enough, sometimes pushing actions are needed in order to move an object in a pose in which it can be grabbed. The planner here presented is able to understand when, and where, to push an object and why it is not possible to grasp it.

This work shows how some geometric problems can be efficiently handled by reasoning at an abstract level through symbolic predicates when such predicates are chosen correctly. The advantage of this kind of planning system is a reduction in computation time and also an easier implementation.
