\abstract{
Manipulation planning is a field of study with increasing interest, it \DMC{merges}{combines} manipulation skills \DMC{with}{and} an artificial intelligence system that is able to find the optimal sequence of actions in order to solve manipulation problems. \DMC{Those problems are complex}{It is a complex problem} since \DMC{they involve}{it involves} a mixture of symbolic planning and geometric planning. 

In this thesis we present a planning system for clearing a table \DMC{of}{with} cluttered objects, which \DMC{completely}{} reasons at a symbolic level and \DMC{postponing the reasoning with}{reasons about} geometric constraints through backtracking. \DMC{The task we face is a complex task that should include geometric information, such as the objects positions, during the planning step. }{Move this sentence up, and say something like: A sequence of actions that completes the task and satisfies a set of geometrical restrictions is required...}
We show that the planning system developed is able to handle efficiently the task \DMC{with symbolic predicates.}{}

The main contribution of this thesis is a planning system \DM{that is} able to solve a wider variety of scenarios for clearing a table \DMC{of}{with} cluttered objects. Grasping actions alone are not enough, \DMC{sometimes}{and} pushing actions \DMC{are}{may be} needed \DMC{in order}{} to move an object \DMC{in}{to} a pose in which it can be \DMC{grabbed}{grasped}. The planner \DMC{here presented}{presented here} \DMC{is able to understand when, and where, to push an object and why it is not possible to grasp it.}{can reason about sequences of pushing and grasping actions that allow a robot to grasph an objects that was not initially graspable.}

This work shows \DMC{how}{that} some geometric problems can be efficiently handled by reasoning at an abstract level through symbolic predicates when such predicates are chosen correctly. The advantage of this \DMC{kind of planning}{} system is a reduction in \DMC{computation}{execution} time and \DM{it is} also \DMC{an}{} easier implementation.
