  abstract = {Manipulation planning from high-level task specifications, even though highly
      desirable, is a challenging problem. The large dimensionality of manipulators and complexity
      of task specifications make the problem computationally intractable. This work introduces a
      manipulation planning framework with linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. The use of
      LTL as the specification language allows the expression of rich and complex manipulation
      tasks. The framework deals with the state-explosion problem through a novel abstraction
      technique. Given a robotic system, a workspace consisting of obstacles, manipulable objects,
      and locations of interest, and a co-safe LTL specification over the objects and locations,
      the framework computes a motion plan to achieve the task through a synergistic multi-layered
      planning architecture. The power of the framework is demonstrated through case studies, in
      which the planner efficiently computes plans for complex tasks. The case studies also
      illustrate the ability of the framework in intelligently moving away objects that block
      desired executions without requiring backtracking. },

abstract = "Abstract We present an approach for planning robotic manipulation tasks that uses a learned mapping between geometric states and logical predicates. Manipulation planning, because it requires task-level and geometric reasoning, requires such a mapping to convert between the two. Consider a robot tasked with putting several cups on a tray. The robot needs to find positions for all the objects, and may need to nest one cup inside another to get them all on the tray. This requires translating back and forth between symbolic states that the planner uses, such as stacked (cup1,cup2), and geometric states representing the positions and poses of the objects. We learn the mapping from labelled examples, and importantly learn a representation that can be used in both the forward (from geometric to symbolic) and reverse directions. This enables us to build symbolic representations of scenes the robot observes, but also to translate a desired symbolic state from a plan into a geometric state that the robot can achieve through manipulation. We also show how such a mapping can be used for efficient manipulation planning: the planner first plans symbolically, then applies the mapping to generate geometric positions that are then sent to a path planner.

	abstract = {We propose a visual scene interpretation system for cognitive robots to maintain a consistent world model about their environments. This interpretation system is for our lifelong experimental learning framework that allows robots analyze failure contexts to ensure robustness in their future tasks. To efficiently analyze failure contexts, scenes should be interpreted appropriately. In our system, LINE-MOD and HS histograms are used to recognize objects with/without textures. Moreover, depth-based segmentation is applied for identifying unknown objects in the scene. This information is also used to augment the recognition performance. The world model includes not only the objects detected in the environment but also their spatial relations to efficiently represent contexts. Extracting unary and binary relations such as on, on_ground, clear and near is useful for symbolic representation of the scenes. We test the performance of our system on recognizing objects, determining spatial predicates, and maintaining consistency of the world model of the robot in the real world. Our preliminary results reveal that our system can be successfully used to extract spatial relations in a scene and to create a consistent model of the world by using the information gathered from the onboard RGB-D sensor as the robot explores its environment.},
