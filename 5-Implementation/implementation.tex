Talk about ROS and real robot. 

For the collision checking the Flexible Collision Library (FCL) \citep{pan2012fcl} has been used. This library allows to define the collision problem in a simpler manner than other more famous collision libraries such as \textit{Bullet} \citep{Bullet}, and it can work with different objects shapes such as box, spheres, cone, convex, mesh and octree. 
The main library used in this work is the Point Cloud Library (PCL) \citep{PCL_}, which allows some methods to create an object shape from a point cloud.
